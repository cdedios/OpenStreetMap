## What is OpenStreetMap

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. Two major driving forces behind the establishment and growth of OSM have been restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices.

## Project goal

The goal of the project is to use the osm open files of the OSM parse them and convert them to Java Objects. Then we will be able to do some searches on them.
